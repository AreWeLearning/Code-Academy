            Nittens is about 2 years old now. I got him in May of 2021. He was such a small kitten and he 
            hardly ever purred. Even now, he only faintly purrs.  
            Now he is a hefty cuddlebug. He loves to sleep in between my feet at night. He loves belly rubs as well as kisses. 
            For some reason he is very skittish,but we're not sure why.

            Wayne is Nittens' brother from the same litter. Wayne doesn't carry his weight nearly as much, but he is much more 
            protective of his food. Although both of them are sweet, Wayne definitely prefers to warm up to people. He is a cuddler, 
            but not quite like Nittens. He can be held, but not for long.
